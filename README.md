## 📌 Project Overview

**Simon Game** is a classic memory-based game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game tests the player’s ability to remember and repeat an increasing sequence of colors. With each level, the sequence grows, making the game more challenging and engaging.

This project is ideal for demonstrating **JavaScript logic**, **event handling**, and **interactive UI development**, making it attractive to recruiters and beginners alike.

## 📜 How the Game Works

1. Press **START GAME** or any keyboard key to begin
2. Game flashes a random color (Level 1)
3. User clicks the same color
4. Each new level adds one more color to the sequence
5. User must repeat the full sequence correctly
6. Wrong input → **Game Over** and score is shown
7. Restart by pressing any key or Start button
